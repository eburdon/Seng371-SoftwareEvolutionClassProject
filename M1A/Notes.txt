Python source file download size
--------------------------------
Here I tried to somehow create a script to find all the python tarball location links, and find the filesize of the downloads. 
Unfortunately, basically every other Python download page is formatted slightly different than the other, so this didn't work 
too well. I managed to return a Microsft Excel file of the version name and their release date; I will have to determine and 
enter the file sizes manually.

If I had more time, I would have dedicated more time into making a script for each page variant, as well as some sort of 
handling for the pages that didn't include the file size download info right on the source page. Unfortunately in this case, 
manual (paired with a nice white wine) was the best path.

On a happier note, Import.Io pushed me into storing my data in Excel. This program includes graphing capabilities, and I was 
able to easily chart my results.

The tgz, gz compress tarball was the only version download type available consistently across all versions - other compressed 
version, were often missing.

There are 73 versions released so far, Most recently Decemeber 12, 2014. Several are now out-of-date and/or have been 
superseded by following versions.

History of Python
-----------------
I found a GOURCE video of the evolution of Python projects - it is clear to see the number of developers, files, and
complexity increasing. Screenshots have been included in images/

Current: Details of Growth
--------------------------
Will probably work with MonkeyLearn to get details of each release
