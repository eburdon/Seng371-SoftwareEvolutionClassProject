The evolution of a language
------------------------------------------

In this class so far, we have been discussing the evolution of ultra-large scale (ULS) projects and how they have evolved. We've looked at some different code bases, have read a few essays by Fred Brooks in his book "Mythical Man Month", and have learnt about the 8 laws of evolution. For project 1, each student has been asked to build some sort of "tool" and study a code base in order to answer questions about Software Evolution.

Instead of looking at a code base, I wanted to attempt to study the evolution of a programming language. This will be an in-depth, specific tool with 3 well defined methodologies as opposed to a general tool that I can apply to 3 different code bases/languages.

My question: <b>"How has Python become more powerful over time?"</b>

I have split my question into three ideas, each of which I believe contributes to the strength of a language.

1. Source Code (core; complexity of the language)

2. Supported Projects

3. Community (sociotechnical environment)

They each define some smaller questions their results hope to answer. This README file only contains a brief overview of each methodology - please visit folders M1\_ComplexityLanguage, M2\_SupportedProjects, and M3\_Community for step-by-step explanations of the exact steps I took in each one. This will include any source files, compile/run instructions, a list of links to each tool I used, a list of metrics, and a list of sources.

Overview of Methodologies
------------------------------------------

This section gives a brief overview of each methodology. Detailed steps, results (such as RAW files and some visualizations),
analysis and discussion, as well as future work are discussed only in the appropriate readme file.


<b>Complexity of the Language - <i>Source code</i></b> 

>How has Python grown? Can we determine if it has evolved into a more complex core?

<b>Supported Projects</b>

>How have the <i>kinds</i> of projects Python can support, evolved? Are users able to accomplish more with Python now than 
before?

[Methodology 2 README](./M2_SupportedProjects/M2_README.md)

SUMMARIZING PARAGRAPH

------------------------------------------

<b>Use of the Language - <i>Community</i></b> 

>How has the Python community grown? Why has this happened?

[Methodology 3 README](./M3_Community/M3_README.md)

Results
------------------------------------------
Overarching discussion; include some key visualization

How is my project question answered?

Future work?


Project Management - self-directed project
------------------------------------------

* Tools used:

Trello: Project planning tool that organizes tasks into cards on a board.

Availble at: [trello.com](https://trello.com/)

------------------------------------------

* Milestones:

January 30 - Finalize questions, methodologies, and tools - make sure they're reasonable!

Week of: Februrary 1 (First Sunday) - Begin & complete "Complexity of the Language - Source code"

Week of: February 8  - Begin & Complete "Complexity of the Language - Projects"

Week of: February 15 - Begin & complete "Use of the Language - Community"

February 22 - Ensure all data is compiled into repository. Prepare repo for submission

<b>February 23</b> - <b>Project Due Date!</b> Hand in results

------------------------------------------

* Some obstacles

The biggest obstacle I had was that the data I wanted to collect was not neccesarily in the format I wanted. For example,
for Part 2 - community, I wanted to collect from the python community website the number of registered user, and hopefully 
parse some sort of information about who they are - academics (students/teachers), professionals, or hobbyists/general 
public. This information is not publicly available. As such, this methodology does not neccessarily have any hard number 
results, and instead forced me to rely on anecdotal evidence such as blog and forum postings, and infer my results from 
there.

In addition, while I started this project off strong (effectively sticking to the timeline), other class assignments, lab 
work, and midterms took priority over research, leading to new time constraints. Sorry.
