Some interesting numbers
-------------------------

I visited the PyPi index and parsed the most and least popular packages (currently available) based on number of downloads. I hoped to get some useful information about each package based on their sizes, but in the end realized that this information doesn't demonstrate anything related to Python's evolution. If I continued down this route, I would have been investigating questions such as "What makes one package more popular than the other?" and other related ideas.

Since I did collect them however, I've included them as part of this project in the two tables below.
