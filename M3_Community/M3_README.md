# Methodology 3
# Evolution of the Python Community

This is the final methodology which attempts to investigate how the Python community has evolved. Similar to M2 however, I had many problems in this part trying to find solid statistics and numbers about Python's sociotechnical environment. As a result, the results of this methodology are small, but they do clearly outline how the community has changed.

----------

Steps
-----

1) Register for and explore the python community at https://www.python.org/community/; Collect information about users.

2) Determine how Python is used in the community - primarily as a teaching tool, prototyping, or end-result development? Are 
there any community events featuring Python?
   
3) Investigate teaching tools and programs (e.g., Hour of Code) - When did they start to include Python? Why?

Results
----------

After registering as a user on the official Python webpages, I was expecting to be able to see more information about other 
Python users such as age, occupation, and other generic statistics that I would have been able to parse to generate some 
numbers. Unfortunately, much like methodology 2, this information was not available. The Python community is a great resource
for learning how to use the language, learning about other projects, receiving updates, and general chat, but there are no 
public profiles (as I was expecting). Unfortunately, this means that the best result I have for determining who uses Python 
is fully reliant on readings and blog posts.

From the history of Python, I believe it is clear that the original users were technically-skilled people currently working 
in industry. However, as evidenced at UVic, and more recently with coding campaigns such as 'Hour of Code,' the user base has expanded to include academics and the general public.

While the user base is not explicitly clear, it is easy to see how Python is used in the community. Let's first look at 
Python's use in industry, then how it is used in academia and in the general domain.

* Python in industry

There is an official Python conference, PyCon, held every year. It is a convention for the community using and developing the
language. While there are technically several conceferences held in a number of of countries, I chose to look at the numbers 
for the most official conference which started in the United States. It is now hosted in Montreal, Canada. 

Here are the attendance numbers and locations:

|Year |   Location       |     Num Attendees |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|
| 2003 | Washington, D.C. | 200 |
| 2004 | Washington, D.C. | 300 |
| 2005 | Washington, D.C. | 400 |
| 2006 | Dallas, TX       | 400 |
| 2007 | Dallas, TX       | 500 |
| 2008 | Chicago, IL      | 1000 |
| 2009 | Chicago, IL      | 900 |
| 2010 | Atlanta, GA      | 1000 |
| 2011 | Atlanta, GA      | 1400 |
| 2012 | Santa Clara, CA  | 2300 |
| 2013 | Santa Clara, CA  | 2500 |
| 2014 | Montreal, QC     | 2500 |


The converence has been consistently successful, and as a result, the number of people attending Pycon is increasing.


* Python in academia and public life:

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get any hard statistics about when Python was included in any official school curriculums. 
For UVic, I could only find anecdotal evidence about when it was included (a few years back), why (the students revolted), 
and how successful it was (it's still being taught). Similarly, for other schools, I can only seem to find the occasional 
forum post about the increased use of Python in their classroom, or how it's been used "for a few years."

Therefore, for more concrete information I looked toward the hugely successful 'Hour of Code' campaign
launched by Code.com, aiming to get programming concepts (some via the Python language) into classrooms featuring as young as
5! This campaign has highlighted the wide number of online platforms availble for learning programming, and especially for 
learning Python.

Here are some numbers : <b>Hour of Code</b>
* Created January 2013
* Campaign launched December 2013 (during Computer Science Education week) 
* As of 20/02/2015, 102,034,915 students served
* 5,296,769,634 Lines of code written by students
* 13 Celebrity Video chats

No graph is needed to highlight the movement of Python into mainstream general public - any generic Google search related to 
this topic will hail Python as a great learning language, quickly gaining popularity across all age gropus.

Some of the learning platorms who participated in Hour of Code which are also teaching Python include:

<b> codecademy </b> 
   * New York City, United states
   * Founded 2011
   * [Available Python courses here](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python)

<b> Grok <b> 
   * (exclusive focus on Python and Logo)
   * Sydney, Austrailia
   * Founded 2013
   * [Available here](https://groklearning.com/csedweek/)

Given how recent these campaigns and media movements towards programming and Python are, I didn't try to collect any 
statistics - it is too soon to be seeing any signifanct impacts on the evolution of Python, except for the fact that the 
Python community is growing, and now has a set of young learners who may continue to use Python in the future, potentially 
driving new features and changes into the language.

Discussion and Analysis
-----------------------

The lack of statistics in this section is evidence of how the affects of Python's socio-technical environment evolution has 
yet to be seen. All of the information found and presented here is remarkably recent, meaning that the community has not yet 
had any direct impact on Python, except for the potential of a new generation growing into positions to both use and continue
developing the language. The anecdotal evidence presented is clear indication here that the community has evolved from pure 
industry professionals to the general public, even without any hard numbers of who the users and developers really are. While
the laws of software engineering may not apply here, I believe the community will come to obey Law V (Conservation of 
Familiarity), where the current students of Python will favor its continued evolution out of legacy, high skill, and loyalty 
to the language.

Obstacles
----------

My greatest obstacle was very similar to the obstacles I faced in methodology 2 where the information I wanted was
unavailable, and so I was unable to parse and hard numbers/data from it. For example: information about the registered Python
community is not publicy available. I was hoping that, with the  creation of every profile, users had to include their age
and some sort of information about what they used Python for, e.g.: teaching/student, web development, professional
development, hobbyist. I intended to parse this information to get a trend of user demographics over time (increasingly more
young members?) and the number of academic, profssional, and general public users. I hoped to be able to explicitly prove
that Python has changed from being used purely as a scripting language among professional developers into a full
general-purpose programming language across all skill levels.

Future Work
----------

* Continue monitoring the number of new students introduced to Python; Follow Hour of Code

* Count and chart the number of courses offered in Python per school insitution; update yearly

* Count and chart the number of school insitutions teaching Python; update yearly

* Attend a Python Conference
