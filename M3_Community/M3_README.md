# Methodology 3
# Evolution of the Python Community

This final methodology attempts to investigate how the Python community has changed over the years, and if/how it has 
influenced changes in the language.

----------

Steps
-----

1) Register for and explore the python community at https://www.python.org/community/ and try to collect information about fellow users.

2) Determine how Python is used in the community - primarily as a teaching tool, prototyping, or end-result development? Are 
there any community events featuring Python?
   
3) Investigate teaching tools and programs (e.g., Hour of Code) - When did they include Python?

There is an official Python conference, PyCon, every year. While several are held in a variety of countries, I chose to look 
at the numbers for the most official conference that started in the United States, and is now hosted in Canada. 

Here are the attendance numbers and locations:

|Year |   Location       |     Num Attendees |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|
| 2003 | Washington, D.C. | 200 |
| 2004 | Washington, D.C. | 300 |
| 2005 | Washington, D.C. | 400 |
| 2006 | Dallas, TX       | 400 |
| 2007 | Dallas, TX       | 500 |
| 2008 | Chicago, IL      | 1000 |
| 2009 | Chicago, IL      | 900 |
| 2010 | Atlanta, GA      | 1000 |
| 2011 | Atlanta, GA      | 1400 |
| 2012 | Santa Clara, CA  | 2300 |
| 2013 | Santa Clara, CA  | 2500 |
| 2014 | Montreal, QC     | 2500 |

Online teaching platforms that include Python:

Hour of Code - Created January 2013; Campaign launched December 2013 during Computer Science Education week. As of 20/02/2015, HoC has served 102,034,915 students.

Discussion and Analysis
-----------------------

Unfortunately specific data about Python community users was unavailable from the Python website - I've included more 
information about this in the 'Obstacles' section below. But, as you can see from Table 1 in the results section, the number 
of people actively particpating in the Python community's PyCon is growing. We can assume that those attending the conference
(or at least speaking) are making significant contributions toward the language's packages. However, this doesn't give us any
insight into who the users of the community really are, only that their numbers are increasing.

There is, however, evidence that the computer science/development/coding community as a whole - all languages and all over 
the world - is evolving to include more of the general public, and Python is a part of that! Recent campaign successes, such as Hour of Code, and anecdotal evidence is valid evidence of this.

Obstacles
----------

My greatest obstacle was identical to the problem I had in methodology 2 - the information I wanted was unavailable, and so I
was unable to parse and hard numbers/data from it.

For example, information about the registered Python community is not publicy available. I was hoping that,  with the 
creation of every profile, users had to include their age and some sort of information about what they used Python for, e.g.:
teaching/student, web development, professional development, hobbyist. I intended to parse this information to get a trend of
user demographics over time (increasingly more young members?) and the number of academic, profssional, and general public 
users. I hoped to be able to explicitly prove that Python has changed from being used purely as a scripting language among 
professional developers into a full general-purpose programming language across all skill levels.
