To show this, let's look at some of the big movements towards learning programing languges:

* Hour of Code - Campaign website
  :: CODE.ORG -- mostly american; can bring in canada
  Launched 2013

* codecademy - HoC particpant
    New York City, United states
    Founded 2011

* Grok - exclusive focus on Python and Logo - HoC Particpant
    Sydney, Austrailia
    Founded 2013

* What does this mean for the evolution of Python?

Given how recent all this information is, I believe we haven't yet seen any shocking evolutions in the Python community - the 
effects have yet to be seen. But, more people are learning Python as their first programming language, or just in general. 
This means the code bases won't be strictly data analysis or professional tools. I believe we'll be more creative projects as 
time goes on from hobbyists. These things might just change the world! After all, Python can be used to "bridge the gap between 
abstract computing and real world application" via Raspberry Pi. I believe we'll see Python's packages continue to develop 
and generate more functionality and thus move the power of the language forward, and more dominant.

Referring to the graphs in the previous module, I think it's safe to say the number of Python users is increasing
