METHODOLOGY:
   
   A) Explore the python community at: https://www.python.org/community/ and find out what's going on publicly. Are most of the members purely acaemics or industry workers? How have the demographics (age, locations, purpose) changed over time?
   
   B) Explore GitHub by running a search - How many Python projects are there? Has this increased over time?
   
   C) Investigate teaching tools and programs (e.g., Hour of Code) - When did they include Python?
   
   D) Collect information on UVic teaching programs - When was Python introduced into the cirriculum? Why?
   
   
   TOOLS:  (To be determined - mostly manpower at this point)
