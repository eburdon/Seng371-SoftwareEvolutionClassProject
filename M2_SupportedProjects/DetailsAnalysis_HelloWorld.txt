As we saw above, a huge advantage of Python is that it's easy to read (clear code), development is fast, and the python 
community is so-well formed, there's plenty of help to be found, and other projects to be referenced.

One of the reasons why Python has spiked in popularity may be its learning curve - or lack thereof. It's easy to teach and 
even easier to learn! In fact, in July 2014, Python passed Java in being the popular language for teaching intoductory 
computer science in U.S. departments. [QUOTE]

* What evidence is there of Python being chosen over other languages?

To see python's current ranking among languages on GitHub, check this out (Top 100 languages):

Python ranks in at #5, behind JavaScript, Java, PHP, and C#. Of course, this is just immediate, 2014-exclusive results. 
How has Python increased over time? With that slick sqeue, I've found some interesting graphs for you! 

> Python in a specific domain (Data science)
// SHOULD THIS BE IN METHODOLOGY 1
David Smith wrote post on revolutionanalytics.com, commenting on how Python is "evolving beyond a data <i>processing</i> tool to 
data <i>analysis</i> tool." This was not done by changing the source code however - this was done via "Pandas," a Python data 
analysis library (a downloadable package).
