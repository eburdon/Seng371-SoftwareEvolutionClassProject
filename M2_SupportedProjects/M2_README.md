# Methodology 2
# Evolution of projects supported by Python

This is Methodolgy 2, the study of the evolution of projects supported by Python. Don't worry - this process is much smaller than methodology 1. It's a single focus that tries to look at reasons and trends behind using Python in projects.

The original intention with this methodology was to search GitHub and SourceForge for two medium-sized programs that 
accomplished the same task. I planned to parse some information such as lines of code (LOC), use Gource to inspect the 
changes in structures of the projects, then gather other source-file metrics. I later realized however, that this process 
would have just compared the two software programs and languages, not offering any insight into the evolution of Python.

As a result, I shifted my search into trying to find how the number of Python projects over time, and the types/functionality
of python projects developed over time. 

It's important to state that this section is lacking in hard numbers. It is much more research based, and I was not able to 
find resources to parse any significant numbers from. I researched blog posts and looked for trend graphs about the use of 
Python.

Steps
-----

1) Compare two programs in C and Python to determine some key statistical differences between the two; establish why Python is popular to learn and use

2) Read some Python success stories and other Python documentation to determine what kind of projects have been supported using Python

3) Read blog posts and collect graphs to prove increased use of Python over time
