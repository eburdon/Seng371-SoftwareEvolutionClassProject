 METHODOLOGY:
  
  a.1) I need to find two medium-sized programs on GitHub written in two different languages (e.g., Python and C) that achieve the same result (e.g., "Hello, World!")
  
  a.2) Compare their LOC - is Python generally simpler in size and verbosity?
  
  a.3) I can use GOURCE to compare the structure of the projects to find out: 1. how long it took to build, 2. compare complexity of the structure, and 3. average number of contributing developers. I can then tabularize this data and attempt to find a useful result.

  ** I just discovered that Reddit came online in 2008, and is majority based (~ 57%) in Python. As such, I want to quickly try to chart the number of code bases or significant sized projects (i.e., no small automation scripts) vs time, to see if they have increased
  
  b.1) Attempt to search GitHub for number of projects of a certain size written in python (open source); As time goes on, does this number increase? Are the average size of the projects also increasing?
  
  b.2) Attempt a google search to find other large projects written in Python.
  
  b.3) What types of tools are these? Large scripts, or functional programs?
  
  b.3) Are the majority of Python projects open source or private?
